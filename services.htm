<h3><span class="auto-style1">A variety of Sim-only and mobile phone contract 
offers are available from BT Mobile, a mobile service provider. Because BT 
Mobile is a virtual provider, it makes use of the network infrastructure of 
another provider, in this case the EE network. It provides coverage for 3G, 4G, 
and 5G. Although it does offer a limited selection of smartphone contracts, BT 
Mobile primarily offers Sim-only plans that you use with your own cellphone.<br>
<br>Additionally, you can pay more to get faster 4G download speeds (up to 
60Mbps instead of 30Mbps), but this is now included for free with any 10GB plan 
or higher. You can also add bundles of extra data or minutes.</span><br>&nbsp;</h3>
